> **üè• Healthcare Laboratory Quality Assurance Solution**  
> A comprehensive SQL Server solution for comparing Point-of-Care (POC) laboratory tests with traditional laboratory methods in healthcare settings, enabling systematic quality assurance and patient safety improvements.

## Overview

This tool enables laboratory management to systematically identify and investigate discrepancies between paired POC and traditional laboratory test results. Originally developed at Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital, it provides automated analysis across six major test families with clinical time-window based comparisons.

**Primary Benefits:**
- **Patient Safety Enhancement** - Systematic discrepancy detection and investigation
- **Quality Assurance Automation** - Replaces manual comparison processes  
- **Executive Visibility** - PowerBI dashboard for laboratory performance monitoring
- **Clinical Integration** - Aligns with existing laboratory workflows and protocols
- **Evidence-Based QA** - Data-driven quality improvement initiatives

## Key Features

### Core Test Family Comparisons
- **Glucose** (POC vs Lab) - 30-minute comparison window
- **Creatinine** (iSTAT vs Lab) - 24-hour comparison window  
- **Hematocrit** (iSTAT vs Lab) - 30-minute comparison window
- **Hemoglobin** (POC vs Lab) - 30-minute comparison window
- **Troponin** (iSTAT vs High Sensitivity) - 30-minute comparison window
- **Urinalysis** (POC vs Microscopic) - 30-minute comparison window

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Statistical Analysis** - Automated discrepancy rate calculations and correlation patterns
- **Dual Operation Modes** - Query mode for direct analysis, stored procedure mode for PowerBI integration
- **Performance Monitoring** - Built-in execution time tracking and row count reporting
- **Cross-Facility Adaptability** - Parameterized design for implementation at multiple healthcare facilities
- **Security Compliance** - HIPAA-compliant data handling with VA certificate-based signing

## Implementation at VA Facilities

### Prerequisites
- **NDS Operational Access** for PHI/Real SSN data sources
- **SQL Server Access** to VhaCdwDwhSql33.vha.med.va.gov with VA credentials
- **Database Permissions** (read-only for basic queries, write access for stored procedures)
- **Facility Configuration** (station number and test SID mappings)

### Quick Implementation
üëâ **[Follow the Complete Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md)** for step-by-step implementation instructions.

### PowerBI Template Access
For security compliance, the PowerBI template is distributed through secure VA channels only:
- **VA Users**: Email Kyle.Coder@va.gov after deploying SQL components
- **Requirements**: Valid VA email, facility information, deployment confirmation

## Clinical Impact & Quality Assurance

### Why This Analysis Matters
Laboratory test discrepancies between POC and traditional methods can indicate:
- Equipment calibration issues requiring maintenance
- Sample collection methodology variations  
- Processing method discrepancies needing standardization
- Patient condition changes between sample collections
- Quality assurance opportunities for laboratory improvement

### Time Window Clinical Justification
Each test family uses clinically appropriate comparison windows based on:
- Physiological stability of the analyte
- Expected rate of change in patient conditions
- Sample degradation and processing considerations
- Laboratory medicine best practices and protocols
