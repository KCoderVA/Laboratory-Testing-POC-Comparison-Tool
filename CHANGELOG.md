## Release Notes

### Version 2.0.0 - GitHub Public Release
This major release represents the public open-source version of the Laboratory Testing POC Comparison solution. Key highlights include:

**🚀 Community Ready**
- MIT License for widespread adoption
- Comprehensive documentation for easy implementation
- Cross-facility adaptation guidance
- Professional repository structure

**🔒 Security Enhanced**
- Complete removal of sensitive content
- HIPAA-compliant data handling
- Anonymized patient identifiers only
- Open-source security best practices

**📊 Production Proven**
- 33 development iterations refined into stable release
- Proven in production at Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital
- Handles 10,000-50,000 test results per fiscal year
- 2-5 minute execution time for comprehensive analysis

**🏥 Clinical Value**
- Systematic laboratory quality assurance
- Early detection of equipment calibration issues
- Improved patient safety through discrepancy identification
