## Understanding the Results

### Key Metrics Explained

#### Time Difference Analysis
**What it shows:** How much time elapsed between POC and standard tests
```
Example: POC Glucose at 08:15, Standard Glucose at 08:45 = 30 minutes
```

**Clinical Significance:**
- **<30 minutes:** Excellent correlation expected
- **30-60 minutes:** Good correlation, minor physiological changes possible
- **>60 minutes:** Moderate correlation, consider clinical context
- **>240 minutes:** Poor correlation expected, significant physiological changes likely

#### Result Comparison
**What it shows:** Numerical difference between POC and standard results
```
Example: POC Glucose 95 mg/dL, Standard Glucose 98 mg/dL = 3 mg/dL difference
```

**Clinical Interpretation:**
- Compare differences to established clinical decision limits
- Consider analytical measurement uncertainty
- Evaluate clinical significance of discrepancies

#### Statistical Summary
**Correlation Coefficient (r):**
- **r > 0.9:** Excellent correlation
- **r 0.8-0.9:** Good correlation  
- **r 0.7-0.8:** Moderate correlation
- **r < 0.7:** Poor correlation, investigate

**Bias Analysis:**
- **Positive bias:** POC consistently higher than standard
- **Negative bias:** POC consistently lower than standard
- **No bias:** POC and standard results similar on average

### Test-Specific Considerations

#### Troponin Testing
**Clinical Context:**
- Rises with cardiac injury, peaks at different times

**Expected Correlation:**
- **Timing is critical** - troponin levels change rapidly
- **Compare assay types** (standard vs high-sensitivity)
- **Clinical correlation** essential for interpretation

#### Urinalysis Testing
**Clinical Context:**
- Can change rapidly with hydration, medications
- POC dipstick vs microscopic examination differences
